Okay, so the user has provided a list of 500 stocks with their current market prices and wants me to classify them into three categories: short-term, mid-term, and long-term. They want 3-5 stocks in each category with specific entry, target, and stop loss prices, along with reasons. The user also emphasized not repeating any stock and ensuring the entry is near the CMP.

First, I need to analyze each stock's potential based on different time frames. For short-term trades (1-5 days), I should look for stocks that might have a quick upside due to news, technical indicators, or other short-term factors. Maybe stocks near support levels or showing bullish divergence.

Mid-term trades (2-8 weeks) would involve stocks with more stable trends or those that are consolidating and might break out soon. I might consider stocks in sectors expected to perform well in the coming weeks or those with improving fundamentals.

Long-term trades (3+ months) should focus on stocks with strong fundamentals, growth potential, or those in sectors expected to grow over the next quarter. Companies with expanding operations or those in industries like renewable energy or IT might fit here.

I should go through each stock one by one, checking their CMPs, and think about any recent news or trends. For example, IRCTC has been in the news with the rail ministry's initiatives, which could boost its stock. So, it might be a good mid-term pick.

Looking at DABUR, it's a strong FMCG company with consistent performance, making it suitable for long-term investment. I'll need to set realistic targets and stop losses based on their current prices.

For the short-term, maybe something like COALINDIA, which is a PSU stock and might react to government policies or demand in the energy sector. It's CMP is 386.1, so I can set a target around 400 and stop loss at 370.

I need to ensure that each stock is only used once, so I'll have to track which ones I've already selected. Let me go through the list, pick the most suitable ones for each category, and assign the necessary details.

I should also make sure that the reasons are concise and relevant, explaining why each stock fits its category. Maybe include factors like sector growth, company performance, or technical analysis points.

I think I've got a good spread across sectors to diversify the picks. Now, I'll format each entry as specified, ensuring the prices are precise and the reasons are clear.
