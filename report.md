Okay, I need to help the user classify 3â€“5 stocks into each of the short-term, mid-term, and long-term categories based on the given CMPs. Since the user is a professional Indian stock trader and advisor, the advice should be realistic and data-driven.

First, I'll consider what factors influence each time frame. For short-term trades (1â€“5 days), I'll look for stocks with recent news, technical indicators suggesting imminent price movements, or events that could cause a quick fluctuation. Maybe stocks near their support or resistance levels.

For mid-term (2â€“8 weeks), I'll focus on stocks with upcoming earnings reports, sector trends, or fundamental analysis that suggests a moderate increase. Perhaps companies in sectors expected to perform well in the coming weeks.

Long-term (3+ months) should involve stocks with strong fundamentals, growth potential, or those in industries expected to boom. I'll consider market leaders or companies with expanding market share.

Looking at the list, I notice some familiar names. For example, TCS is a large-cap company with consistent performance, making it suitable for long-term investment. Similarly, INFY is another IT giant that's reliable for the long haul.

For short-term, maybe look at stocks with recent IPOs or those that have shown volatility. DREAMFOLKS has been in the news lately, so it might have short-term upside. Similarly, IEX is in the energy sector, which might see movement based on policy changes.

In mid-term, stocks like IRCTC could see growth with increased travel and tourism. BEL is a defense stock, which might benefit from government contracts or policy changes in the coming weeks.

I should ensure not to repeat any stocks across categories. I'll go through each CMP and assign based on these factors, making sure each category has 3â€“5 stocks with appropriate entry, target, and stop loss prices.

I might also consider technical indicators like RSI, moving averages, or recent price patterns to set realistic targets and stop losses. For example, if a stock is oversold, it might bounce back in the short term.

Finally, I'll structure the response as per the user's instructions, only using the specified format without any additional explanations or comments.
