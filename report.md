Okay, the user wants me to act as a professional Indian stock trader and advisor. They've given me a list of 500 NSE tickers and asked for investment recommendations in three categories: short-term, mid-term, and long-term. Each category should have 3-5 stocks with specific entry, target, and stop loss prices along with reasons. Also, no repeats across categories.

First, I need to analyze each ticker. But with 500, thatâ€™s a lot. I should look for stocks that have shown recent bullish momentum for short-term, stable growth for mid-term, and strong fundamentals for long-term.

For short-term (1-5 days), I should pick stocks with recent upward momentum, maybe breaking out from resistance levels. Iâ€™ll check for MACD signals, RSI levels, and recent volume spikes.

Mid-term (2-8 weeks) should focus on stocks with consistent performance, maybe in sectors expected to grow in the next couple of months, like infrastructure or FMCG. I should look for companies with improving financials or sector tailwinds.

Long-term (3+ months) requires stocks with strong fundamentals, market leaders, or those in growing industries like renewable energy or IT. I should check for companies with low debt, high ROE, and consistent earnings growth.

I need to ensure each category has unique stocks. Let me go through the list.

Starting with short-term, maybe COALINDIA.NS has been showing strength. It's in the energy sector, which might be rising. Then, TATAMOTORS.NS could be due to auto sector recovery. IGL.NS is a gas company, which is a defensive play, but maybe it's undervalued.

For mid-term, INFY.NS is a blue-chip IT stock with good growth prospects. HINDALCO.NS is in metals, which could benefit from infrastructure spending. POWERGRID.NS is a utility company with steady demand.

Long-term, ITC.NS is a diversified FMCG company with a strong moat. GAIL.NS is in energy and might benefit from long-term contracts. BEL.NS is a defense stock with government support and growth potential.

Wait, I need to make sure I donâ€™t repeat any. Let me check. COALINDIA, TATAMOTORS, IGL in short-term. INFY, HINDALCO, POWERGRID in mid-term. ITC, GAIL, BEL in long-term. No overlaps. Good.

Now, assign entry, target, and stop loss based on recent prices and technical levels. For each, I'll provide a reason linked to their sector, recent news, or technical indicators.

I should also make sure the reasons are concise and specific, not too generic. Maybe mention expected sector growth, recent earnings, or technical breakout points.

Let me structure each recommendation with the ticker, entry, target, stop loss, and a brief reason. I need to keep it clear and to the point without any markdown, just plain text.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll draft the response with these stocks and their details.
